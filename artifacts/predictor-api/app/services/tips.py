"""Turn calibrated model output into per-market tip selections.

Markets map to models like this:

* 1X2, Double Chance      - directly from the match_winner model
* BTTS                    - directly from the btts model
* Over/Under 2.5          - directly from the over_under_2_5 model
* Other goal lines (1.5, 3.5) - DERIVED, not separately trained: total goals are
  modelled as Poisson around the expected-goals estimate. These are labelled
  ``derived`` so the UI can be honest that they are an inference, not a fit.

Every tip carries the probability it was selected on. ``value`` is the gap
between that probability and the odds-implied one; it is the only figure here
that says anything about whether a bet is worth placing.
