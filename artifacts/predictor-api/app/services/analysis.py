"""Deep per-fixture analysis.

Scores every market for one fixture, surfaces the evidence behind it - head to
head, recent form, expected goals - and names one recommended selection.

The recommendation is deliberately not "the highest probability". A 90% double
chance priced at 1.05 is a near-certain way to lose money slowly; the pick that
matters is the one whose probability most exceeds what the market charges for
it, among selections the model actually favours. Where no bookmaker price is
available there is no edge to measure, so the fallback ranks on probability and
says so.
